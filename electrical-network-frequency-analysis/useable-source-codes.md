### Assessing spectral estimation methods for Electric Network Frequency (ENF) Extraction.
* Matlab source codes.
* Signal filtering with a very sharp bandpass filter (main.m).
* ENF extraction procedure using overplapping windows and a Quadratic Interpolation (main.m). Very good results achieved due to proper parameter tuning both in the pre-processing step and in the main procedure.
