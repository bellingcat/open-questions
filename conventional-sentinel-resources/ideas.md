## Ideas

* Sentinel browser works straight out the box with some quite simple vanilla javascript. Could
Bellingcat keep a detailed repository of sentinel scripts that are useful for OSINT work along with instructions
on how to adapt them?
  
* Could an open source python package be developed for common tasks such as deforestation or water detection?
So a user would only have to input dates, co-ordinates and a methodology of interest. For instance,
the last section in [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-open-source-satellite-data-for-your-investigative-reporting-d662cb1f9f90 "How to use open source satellite data for your investigative reporting") article
looks very replicable across different classification schema.
